          1. Seeking urgent directions to stop illegal Sand Mining in Kolohi river and around Chandubi Lake to prevent environmental disasters.<br/>
          2. Urgent Cleaning Required to Save Chandubi Lake from Pollution and Habitat Destruction.<br/>

        </p>
        <p>
          Dear Sir/Madam,
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a citizens' appeal to stop illegal Sand Mining in Kolohi(Kulsi) river and around  Chandubi, Assam.  Chandubi, a beautiful and serene lake in Assam, is on the brink of environmental disaster due to rampant sand mining, and we must act now to save it before it is too late. It is a natural lake in Assam's Kamrup district. The lake was formed in 1897 as a result of a major earthquake in the region, during which a forest area collapsed and became a lake. Since then, the lake has evolved into a vital habitat for flora and fauna (a biodiversity hotspot). The lake is an important source of income for the surrounding communities as well as a popular tourist destination.
        </p>
        <p>
          Illegal sand mining in the lake's catchment area is posing to be a current threat to the lake's ecosystem. Locals who rely on sand mining for a living and are uninformed of the ecological balance have led to uncontrolled sand extraction with no regard for the environmental effects or river habitat ecology. The sand is extracted using machines, which harms the natural habitat and disrupts the flow of water into the lake. Rampant mining using motor pumps has resulted in excessive draining of the riverbed, affecting the normal flow of water in the river. Sand mining is taking place without the government's approval or environmental clearance.
        </p>
        <p>There are several factors contributing to threaten the ecosystem of Chandubi Lake which include the following:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The proliferation of aquatic plants and weeds, which have diminished the lake's water-holding capacity. This is a widespread issue in many bodies of freshwater, and it is frequently caused by nutrient contamination from agricultural runoff and untreated sewage.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The loss of underground water streams that once fed into Chandubi Lake is causing the lake to shrink. This is due to sediment deposition in the lake, which can clog the canals that connect the lake to the subsurface streams. The lake must be thoroughly cleaned and the catchment region must be conserved to prevent further sediment deposition and loss of water holding capacity. 
        </p>
        <p>
          3. In addition to addressing the threats to the ecosystem of Chandubi Lake, it is important to consider how the lake could benefit from recognition under the Ramsar Convention. By doing so, stakeholders can collaborate to improve the wetland's overall condition; including enhancing the living standards of the locals while fulfilling the ecological needs of the lake.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The Ramsar Convention is a global organization that works towards the conservation and sustainable use of wetlands. Through its recognition, stakeholders can collaborate to improve the wetland's overall condition; including enhancing the living standards of the locals while fulfilling the ecological needs of the lake. Such efforts can promote the socio-economic growth of the area, bringing positive impacts to both the environment and the community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Illegal Sand Mining is a criminal and penal offence under the following legal provisions:
        </p>
        <p>
          i.              Under <strong>Section 378</strong> of the <strong>Indian Penal Code</strong>  which clearly states that <i>Theft.—Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any moveable property out of the possession of any person without that person’s consent, moves that property to such taking, is said to commit theft.</i><br/><br/>
 
ii.            Further <strong>Section 379</strong> of the <strong>Indian Penal Code</strong>, 1860 states <i>whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.</i><br/><br/>
 
iii.           Therefore, <strong>the State Government</strong> is the owner of the mineral; therefore, no person is allowed to transport the sand without permission from the Government<br/><br/>
 
iv.          Illegal Sand Mining is prohibited under <strong>Section 4</strong> of the <strong>Mines and Minerals (Development And Regulation) Act, 1957</strong> which states that <i>Prospecting or mining operations to be under license or lease.<strong>―(1) 4</strong> [No person shall undertake any reconnaissance, prospecting or mining operations in any area, except under and by the terms and conditions of a reconnaissance permit or a prospecting license or, as the case may be, of a mining lease, granted under this Act and the rules made there under;</i><br/><br/>
 
v.           Further, illegal sand mining also invites penalties under <strong>section 21</strong> of the <strong>MMDR Act:</strong> whoever contravenes the provisions of <strong>sub-section (1)</strong> or <strong>sub-section (1A)</strong> of <strong>section 4</strong> shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years and with fine which may extend to five lakh rupees per hectare of the area.<br/><br/>
 
vi.           Also <strong>Section 23C</strong> empowers the Power of the State Government to make rules for preventing illegal mining, transportation, and storage of minerals.―<br/><br/>
 
vii.          (1) The State Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, make rules for preventing illegal mining, transportation, and storage of minerals and for the purposes connected therewith.<br/><br/>
 
viii.          	(2) In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power, such rules may provide for all or any of the following matters, namely:― (a) establishment of check-posts for checking of minerals under transit;<br/><br/>
 
(b) Establishment of weighbridges to measure the number of minerals being transported;<br/><br/>
(c) regulation of minerals being transported from the area granted under a prospecting license or a mining lease or a quarrying license or a permit, in whatever name the permission to excavate minerals, has been given;<br/><br/>
(d) Inspection, checking, and search of minerals at the place of excavation or storage or during transit;<br/><br/>
(e) Maintenance of registers and forms for these rules;<br/><br/>
(f) the period within which and the authority to which applications for revision of any order passed by any authority be preferred under any rule made under this section and the fees to be paid therefor and powers of such authority for disposing of such applications; and<br/><br/>
(g) any other matter which is required to be, or maybe, prescribed for the prevention of illegal mining, transportation, and storage of minerals.<br/><br/>
 
 
 
 	ix. Under <strong>Section 15</strong> of the <strong>Environment Protection Act</strong>, mining of sand without obtaining the necessary consent from the <strong>State Pollution Control Board</strong>/Environment Clearance from the <strong>Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) / State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA)</strong> is an offence under the EP Act.
        </p>
        <p>To conclude, it is most humbly requested you consider the following crucial and significant facts on the ground to stop Sand Mining in Kolohi river and in and around Chandubi Lake:
        </p>
        <p>
        1. The nearby villages rely heavily on Chandubi Lake as a source of income and as a hotspot for biodiversity.
      <br/>
        2. The lake's ecosystem is seriously threatened by illegal sand mining, which harms the environment and interferes with water flow into the lake.
        <br/>
        3. Numerous laws, such as the Mines and Minerals Act and the Environment Protection Act, forbid and prohibit sand mining.
        <br/>
        4. The development of aquatic weeds and plants as well as the disappearance of subsurface water streams are further endangering Chandubi Lake's ecosystem.
        <br/>
        5. The Ramsar Convention's recognition of Chandubi Lake can give major advantages to conservation and the local people.
      </p>
        <p>
          We sincerely hope, and eagerly await your prompt, meticulous, and most urgent consideration of the afore-mentioned problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Solidarity,<br/>
          An environmentally conscious citizen.
